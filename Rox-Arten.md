I live in Sacramento, CA. I have a pretty widely varied background, and love to learn new things.  My first degree program after 
high school was in music and video business, which gave me skills in audio and video production. I later transitioned to Web and 
Graphic design adding art and coding to my skill sets.  I have been a content creator (my store sells clothing, jewlery, accessories, 
and occassionally the random other item that strikes my fancy) , event organizer (running 2 annual treasure hunt events, a summer 
Relay for Life charity event, and a winter holday sale event) , and teacher (teaching others how to create content and get started in 
business) in the virtual world of Secondlife for just over 12 years now.  I am an avid readerand love music.  I play the clarinet and paint 
when I have the time, and overall am pretty ecclectic. I generally have a postive outlook in life, trying to find a positive in everything.
